# Q&A and Wrap-up {-}

## Open discussion for participants to ask questions and share insights {-}

**How do open source and free AI make money ?**
Open sourcing a tool will bring the community together and help develop it further to then be able to use it on their company on paid services like ads or recommendations. To expand more , here are some ways they make money :

**Support and Services:** Offering paid support, consulting, and professional services for businesses that use the open source AI technology. This can include installation, customization, troubleshooting, and ongoing maintenance.

**Dual Licensing:** Some open source projects are released under a dual license model. One license is open source and free for community use, while the other is a commercial license that offers additional features, support, or rights that are attractive to enterprise users.

**SaaS (Software as a Service):** Creating a cloud-based version of the AI tool that is hosted and managed by the organization, which users can access via a subscription model. While the software itself is free to download and use, the cloud service (with its benefits of scalability, management, and sometimes advanced features) is not.

**Donations and Crowdfunding:** Soliciting donations from individuals and organizations that want to support the project. Platforms like GitHub Sponsors, Patreon, or Open Collective facilitate recurring contributions to projects and creators.

**Grants and Funding:** Obtaining financial support from governmental or non-governmental organizations that wish to promote technological development and innovation. This can be particularly prevalent in research-focused AI projects.

**Partnerships:** Entering into partnerships with other companies that can benefit from the AI project. This might involve collaborative development efforts where the partner funds certain aspects of the project.

**Training and Certification:** Providing training programs, workshops, and certification courses for individuals and corporations to effectively use the open source AI tools. These educational services can be a substantial revenue stream.

**Custom Development:** Building custom solutions for clients using the open-source AI as a foundation. This allows organizations to meet specific customer needs while promoting and improving their open-source project.

**Merchandising:** Selling branded merchandise can be a minor but additional revenue stream for popular open source projects.

**Freemium Features:** Offering the core product for free while charging for additional features, functionality, or plugins that enhance the basic version of the software.

**Indirect Monetization:** Sometimes, a company will open source a tool purely for the goodwill and community engagement it brings, which can enhance the company's reputation and indirectly lead to increased sales of their other products or services.
