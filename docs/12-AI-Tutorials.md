## How to Use Chatgpt {.unnumbered}

<https://chat.openai.com/>

First, you need to sign up and then it is completely free to use the AI. 

As any generative text ai tool, one must insert a prompt for the ai to answer. One must be careful how to ask the ai since the prompt is a way to guide the AI into a good answer.

You can learn prompt engineering from coursera's course `Prompt Engineering for ChatGPT` at <https://www.coursera.org/learn/prompt-engineering>.

Usually a good prompt requires a background , you will be setting up the back story for chatgpt, then you ask chatgpt to be a specific specialist such as a lawyer, doctor or english teacher. Then you will indicate how to respond, i.e, please write bullet points, write a 500 word essay, output it in code only and finally provide Chatgpt with the question.

Example from [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/06/12/the-best-prompts-to-show-off-the-mind-blowing-capabilities-of-chatgpt/?sh=1c40062c3f60) are as follows:

I want you to create a schedule for social media posts over one month, starting from [insert date that schedule will start]. The frequency of posting will be [daily/every two days/every weekday/weekly]. My business is called [insert name] and we sell [insert products or services]. For each post, include the day it will be published, a heading, body text and include relevant hashtags. The tone of voice we use is [professional/casual/funny/friendly].

Create 10 ideas for blogs that we can use to demonstrate our expertise in our field and to persuade readers to follow me in order to learn more.

**Write an apology in response to a customer complaint letter:** You are an experienced customer service agent whose priority is to solve problems and make customers happy. Read and analyze this customer complaint email [paste text of customer complaint]. Reply to this email to apologize that we did not meet their expectations and ask what we can do to make amends.

## Use of Bard {-}

I like to use bard for literature review , it is better than chatgpt at giving actual research papers. However, it may still produce wrong information.

## Dalle-3 via Microsoft Bing {-}

<https://www.bing.com/create>

Accessing Dalle-3 via Microsoft Bing is the best and free option. Otherwise, Dalle-3 is a paid ai .

Dalle is focused on image generation, the version 2 was not as great but with intricate prompts one could generate good images. 

In the case of Dalle-3 , simple prompts still give great results. Dalle-3 in comparison to midjourney is a great way to create images using AI without thinking too much on the prompts

All you need to do is type your prompt and then click on create. You are given a daily allowance of tokens.
