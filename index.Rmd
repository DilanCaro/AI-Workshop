The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents both challenges and opportunities for ed-
ucators and students alike. Professors are confronted with the daunting task of addressing the emerging
issue of academic dishonesty fueled by AI technology. With tools that can generate essays, solve problems,
and even mimic human responses, detecting plagiarism and ensuring the authenticity of studentsâ€™ work
becomes increasingly complex. This challenge compels educators to adapt their teaching methodologies, implement innovative assessment techniques, and employ AI-powered plagiarism detection tools to
maintain academic integrity and uphold the value of education
